# Loan_Approval_Prediction
Loan Approval Prediction Using Multi-Model Machine Learning and Feature Engineering
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict loan approval status based on various applicant features. Using a real-world dataset containing applicant income, credit history, loan amount, and other attributes, the project applies rigorous feature engineering and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to optimize predictive capability.

Features and Data
Applicant demographics and financial metrics (Income, Employment, Credit History)

Loan details such as loan amount and loan term

Additional features crafted through domain-specific feature engineering to enhance model performance

Models Used
Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Gradient Boosting Classifier

Results
Achieved model accuracy up to 92.5%

Compared model performance to select the best-performing classifier

Demonstrated robust multi-feature analysis for loan approval classification
